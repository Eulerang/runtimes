# Configuration Options
{: #configuration_options}
{: shortdesc}

## Ensure your application has all of the files needed in the build output folder
{: #configure_output_files}

### Using project.json tooling

Add the following property to the `buildOptions` section of project.json:
```
  "copyToOutput": {
    "include": [
      "wwwroot",
      "Areas/**/Views",
      "Views",
      "appsettings.json"
    ]
  }
```
{: codeblock}

In Startup.cs `Startup` method, remove the following line:
```
  .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
```
{: codeblock}

In Program.cs `Main` method, remove the following line:
```
  .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
```
{: codeblock}

These changes should allow the .NET CLI to find your application's `Views` as they will now be copied to the build output when the `dotnet run` command executes.  If your application has any other files, such as json configuration files, which are required at runtime then you should also add those to the `include` section of `copyToOutput` in the project.json file for your project.

#### Using MSBuild tooling

Add a `<Content>` element to the `<ItemGroup>` element of your .csproj file:
```
  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="wwwroot/**/*;Areas/**/Views/*;Views/*;appsettings.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
      <CopyToPublishDirectory>Always</CopyToPublishDirectory>
    </Content>
  </ItemGroup>
```
{: codeblock}

In Startup.cs `Startup` method, remove the following line:
```
  .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
```
{: codeblock}

In Program.cs `Main` method, remove the following line:
```
  .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
```
{: codeblock}

These changes should allow the .NET CLI to find your application's `Views` as they will now be copied to the build output when the `dotnet publish` command executes.  If your application has any other files, such as json configuration files, which are required at runtime then you should also add those to the `Include` property of the `Content` element in the .csproj file for your project, separated by semi-colons.
