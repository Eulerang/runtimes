## Using Custom Native Libraries
{: #using_custom_native_libraries}

Some libraries may require you to use both a NuGet package and some native library files (.so files).  In order to use these libraries with the buildpack, you should place them in a folder named *ld_library_path* in the root folder of your application.
The buildpack will automatically add this path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable during staging.  Alternatively, you can specify the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in your application's `manifest.yml` file or using the `cf set-env` command to use a different folder name than *ld_library_path*.  In this case, the buildpack will append this custom path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` generated by the buildpack.
